# ng-themed

ng-themed is a theming framework and suite of Angular 8 built bootstrap-like components.
Thanks and acknowledgement to ng-bootstrap for creating the code from which some of these
components were created.

The primary benefit of using this framework is that it allows for the simple recoloring of
a website or web-application either programatically using the provided interface service 
or by simply changing the color codes in the theme scss file.
